This is a typical mail in Star Wars Galaxies. It always has 4 header lines 
but the mail body looks almost whatever. If you encounter an erratic mail, 
please edit the mail, save it and then move it from the ERRORS folder into 
the "next folder", the character's folder.

First line is the the same as the file name.
Second line is the sender, a From field.
Third line is Subject line, it may be empty (blank line).
Fourth line is the TIMESTAMP line, number of seconds since Jan 1, 1970.
Then comes the body:
