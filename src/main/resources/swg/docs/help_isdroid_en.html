  <p><b> Help &mdash; ISDroid Reports </b></p>
  <p> This panel presents you with features to manage reports
    from <u>Interplanetary Survey Droids</u> (aka ISDroids)
    and to upload resource data to swgaide.com. In summary,
    SWGAide scans the ISDroid reports and compares them with
    resources that are listed at swgaide.com and determines
    which resources that are new or depleted, or if they can
    be complemented with stats or planets. Then the result is
    displayed at the GUI elements and you select appropriate
    actions; first you submits depleted resources and planet
    availability; second you write resources to a notes file
    and in-game edit the file with stats; finally you submit
    new and complemented resources to swgaide.com which also
    makes it available in SWGAide. </b></p>

  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b> Setup </b>
  <p> <b>swgaide.com</b> &ndash; to be able to submit resources to swgaide.com you
    must register yourself at the site and you must let SWGAide
    know user-name and password; open the SWGCraft dialog via
    menu <b>Options &raquo; SWGCraft... </b>. SWGAide stores
    the password in encrypted form in the DAT file and it is
    never sent anywhere but only used when communicating with
    SWGCraft, and also then it is strongly encrypted. </p>
  <p> <b>Options</b> &ndash; at menu <b>Options &raquo; ISdroid</b> you specify
    your preferences:
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Allow w/o stats</b> &ndash; allow submission of new resources without stats,
      this is recommended. Resources submitted without stats are
      made visible for more players who can complement them at any
      convenient date; conversely, not submitted resources cannot
      be augmented and possibly they do not trigger depletion of
      older resources (this is Organics). </li>
    <li> <b>Long list</b> &ndash; write to the notes file as one continuous list. The
      list is ordered for convenient browsing of the "30k veteran
      resource crate". Otherwise the output is "planetary", the
      list is written planet by planet, this is for players who
      hand sample for stats. </li>
    <li> <b>Skip duplicates</b> &ndash; do not double resources that are already written to
      the notes file (only in "planetary" mode). Otherwise doubled
      resources are marked with trailing stars (**); you add stats
      just to one of the doubled resources. </li>
    <li> <b>Auto-delete</b> &ndash; allow SWGAide to automatically erase content of the
      notes file after error-free submission to swgaide.com. If
      there is an error the file is retained; a backup is always
      created in the "backups" folder. </li>
    <li> <b>Single report</b> &ndash; select this option to manage ISDroid reports one by
      one rather than all reports in one batch. Default is all in
      one batch which also is safer and a lot faster. </li>
    
    <!--
<li><font face="Arial">
<b>GUI input: 
</b>Enable the GUI input feature, not yet implemented. </font>
</li>
-->
    
    <li> <b>Help text</b> &ndash; always append a help text to the notes file. </li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p><b> Initializing the ISDroid panel </b></p>
This panel populates itself when it is opened. However,
because ISDroid reports arrive as in-game mails you must
first have done   <tt>/mailsave</tt> as for any
  other mail. Then, when opening this panel, if a report is
  older than 4 hours SWGAide displays a warning dialog with
  the options:
  <ul>
    <li> delete the report </li>
    <li> delete <i>all</i> old reports </li>
    <li> continue, which is OK if you know that the data is still
      valid. In fact, a slightly aged report makes no harm, at
      most a few new or a few depleted resources are omitted. </li>
  </ul>
  <p> However, if you realize that you must refresh this panel,
    first see limitation one further down. </p>
  <br/>
  <p><b> GUI Elements </b></p>
  <p> This panel displays four lists of resources that are up for
    action and buttons for these actions. Lists 1 and 2 can be
    submitted right away, without further ado. Lists 3 and 4
    display resources that you are welcomed to update with
    stats before submission (optional); you can also submit
    them without stats right away. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <b>List 1</b> &ndash; resources which are already listed at swgaide.com
      but your reports add one or several planets to them. </p>
    <p> <b>List 2</b> &ndash; resources which are depleted from the galaxy. </p>
    <p> <b>List 3</b> &ndash; new resources which are not yet reported to
      swgaide.com. </p>
    <p> <b>List 4</b> &ndash; resources which are listed at swgaide.com without
      stats; you are welcomed to complement them with stats. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Submit 1 & 2</b> &ndash; press this button to submit everything displayed in
    lists 1 and 2. </p>
  <p> <b>Write to "res.txt"</b> &ndash; press this button to write the content of lists 3
    and 4 to the "res.txt" notes file; select output style as
    described above. If the notes file is not empty SWGAide
    displays a dialog with the options to erase the content,
    or to cancel; a backup is always created in "backups". </p>
  <blockquote> &mdash; Before you press next button, switch to SWG to add
    stats to the resources in the notes file; this is optional
    and if you cannot complement the resources now it is better
    to submit them right away without stats. This way you notify
    others that these resources exist and you also records the
    earliest possible date for their spawn. Otherwise these
    resources are available but nobody knows about them and
    the recorded spawn date is the worse. </blockquote>
  <p> <b>Submit "res.txt"</b> &ndash; </b>press this button to submit the data from lists
    3 and 4 together with the stats you optionally have added
    to the notes file. If there are errors in the notes file
    SWGAide displays a dialog: </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Errors</b> &ndash; when SWGAide reads the updated notes file, but
    before submitting anything to SWGCraft, if there is an
    error it is displayed at a GUI dialog with the options
    to Abort, Edit the line, or Skip the line. If there are
    several error this dialog is displayed for each of them,
    unless you select Abort.
    <ul>
      <li> <b>Abort</b> &ndash; terminate the process so that you can manually
        edit the "res.txt" notes file. Perhaps you can edit the
        file at SWGAide's Main panel, or you may have to find some
        data in SWG. Once you have corrected the error you press
        the submit button once again. Use this option if an error
        cannot be solved by the other options. </li>
      <li> <b>Edit now</b> &ndash; open another dialog at which you can edit the line
        right away, if that is possible. </li>
      <li> <b>Skip line</b> &ndash; ignore whatever you wrote at this line and if it is
        possible SWGAide submits the resource as-is. This usually
        means that SWGAide submits the resource for all planets but
        without stats. </li>
    </ul>
A few other dialogs are possible, they are self-explaining.
    </p>
After submission SWGAide sometimes displays another dialog
about similarly named resources, see further down.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <b> "res.txt" notes file</b> &ndash; the way it looks depends on the options described
  above; this sample of a <b><i>planetary output </i></b> covers the important parts:
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
Chimaera / Lok / 1234567890
swgcraft_start
Alpha,Desh Copper,
Beta,Colat Iron,
swgcraft_end

Chimaera / Tatooine / 1234567890
swgcraft_start
Sigma,Kelsh Copper,
Delta,Dolovite Iron,90,89,78,67,56,45,34,23
Alpha,Desh Copper,**
swgcraft_end</pre>
    </p>
    <p> Notice the two blocks of resources, one for each planet the
      ISDroid reports pertain to. The first line reads the galaxy
      and planet, plus a time stamp of the report. The block is
      delimited by the lines "swgcraft_start" and "swgcraft_end",
      you <u>must <b>not</b> edit these lines</u>. Such a block
      contains just resources that should be complemented with
      stats; each line read a name and a resource class. </p>
    <p> Notice in the second block, the last resource reads some
      trailing ** after the resource class. Compare the blocks
      and see that this Desh Copper was already listed, the stars
      is just a reminder and doubles are always listed last. See
      the option "skip duplicates". </p>
    <p> <b>Long list</b> &ndash; provides a similar list but it is sorted for ease
      of use together with the "30k Veteran Resource Crate" and
      SWGAide keeps track of the planets. </p>
    <p> SWGAide always keeps track of planets, this is true also
      for the planetary style, hence you can manually delete
      doubles if you want to. However, see limitations 2. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>In-game</b> &ndash; within SWG you open a basic notepad by the
    command<b><tt> /note&nbsp;res </tt></b> &ndash; notice that you do not type the<tt> .txt</tt>. For each resource,
    append the stats at the end of the line in the same order
    as stats are read in-game. As delimiter between stats, use
    any of 
    &nbsp;"<tt>,.;: </tt>"
    (white space is OK but quotes are excluded).
    Notice, for manual submission at SWGCraft only comma signs
    and no white spaces whatsoever works as delimiters; see the
    example above, the Dolovite Iron in the second block. </p>
  <p> You obtain resource stats either by hand sampling and read
    their stats at the examine window. However, it is more
    convenient to use a "30k Veteran Reward Resource Crate",
    its correct name is "A&nbsp;crate of free resources". This
    reward is indeed a <b><i>galaxy-wide sampling device</i></b>;
    for each resource class, the most recent resource is almost
    always listed bottommost. Select a resource and the next
    window reads its stats; you back out with Cancel or the
    Escape button of the keyboard; otherwise a confirm dialog
    prevents you from the mishaps we had in the past. </p>
  <p> Once you are done in-game you must close the notepad which
    also saves the notes file to disk so that SWGAide can read
    your notes. Do not have this file open in-game while you
    edit it elsewhere because your edits are overwritten by SWG
    when you close the notepad. </p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b>Similar resource names &mdash; Dialog</b>
  </p>
After SWGAide has submitted resources to SWGCraft,
sometimes this dialog is displayed; this section explains
why, false alerts, and how to act:
  <blockquote> To prevent that you submit resources that double resources
    that are already listed at swgaide.com SWGAide determines
    how similar the names of your resources are with all other
    resources. A <b>spelling error</b> is so easily done, this
    is without competition the most common mistake, either by
    you or another player. If such names are found SWGAide
    displays a dialog with some options. Remember that ISDroids in themselves contain no spelling
    errors, but if a resource is already submitted manually,
    either via SWGAide or at SWGCraft, it may be in error. If
    you then try to upload a report, with a correct name, you
    are about to submit a double.
    <blockquote><b><i> In this case you should not submit but correct the existing
      entry. </i></b></blockquote>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <p> If a resource is <b>similar to several</b> other resources
      you see a cluster of your resource and those with similar
      names. Please, <i>review all </i> alerts in that cluster
      before you decide how to proceed and select at most one of
      the options. </p>
Each entry at the dialog has two buttons; to send your
resource, or to send a name correction, but you can of
course decide to do nothing.
    <blockquote>
      <p> <b>Submit new</b> &mdash; press this button to send your resource as-is;
        see "false alert" below. If your resource is in a cluster,
        review all alerts before you decide how to proceed. </p>
      <p> <b>Submit name</b> &mdash; press this button to send a name correction for the
        existing resource; the other resource is correct except for
        its name &mdash; both your and the older resource must be
        identical except for the names. If your resource is in a
        cluster, review all other alerts. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> Other errors are not handled by this dialog.
      If the resource class is in error you must visit SWGCraft
      to edit the class, or to report the error at the resource
      forum. 
      If planets are in error you must report that at the
      resource forum at SWGCraft; only moderators can resolve
      such errors </p>
    <p> <b>False alerts</b> &mdash; the algorithm to determine if names are similar
      is called the Levenshtein distance; it is quite simple and
      measures how many edits it takes to change one name to the
      other, the edits being replace, add, or erase. Thus, it is
      a fair risk for false alerts every now and then, certainly
      so for the shorter names. 
      To prevent too many false alerts SWGAide also tests the
      resource classes against each other, a quite simple test.
      However, please report your experience so that we can
      improve the logic. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Black-list</b> &ndash; to prevent unwanted clutter in the "res.txt" notes
    file you can create a file named "isdroid_blacklist.txt" in
    the "misc" folder. Type the resource class that you want to
    hide, one class per line; you must spell exactly as the
    classes are read elsewhere in SWGAide. </p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <b> Limitation 1 </b> &mdash; the ISDroid panel retains its content as long as
  you do not switch to another character to view its ISDroid
  panel or as long as you do not exit SWGAide. <br/>
  <b>pros</b>: resource data is not compromised by some other
  action and you can safely submit the content without further
  verification. <br/>
  <b>cons</b>: new data from swgaide.com does not update the
  content of the panel, neither does new ISDroid reports.
  <blockquote> <b>Force an update of this panel</b> &ndash; switch to any other character and view its ISDroid
    panel and then switch back. This resets all internal states
    and refreshes all lists for ISDroid reports but it does not
    overwrite the "res.txt" notes file.
    <p> While you are updating the "res.txt" notes file you <u>do
      not</u> want to switch to another character in SWGAide and
      view the ISDroid panel. If you did, to be able to continue
      must copy or save the content of the file somehow; then you
      press "write to file" to generate an updated file. Notice,
      the new output may be different than the old file: if the
      resources of the two files are identical you can replace
      the content with what you had; otherwise you must line by
      line replace only equal resources, update new resources,
      and not add resources that are missing in the new file. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <p> <b> Limitation 2 </b> &mdash; it happens that somebody wrongly enters a resource
    for a planet where it is not spawning. Assume that someone
    reported a resource for Lok, it is not available there but
    it is available at several other planets, this will happen:
    When SWGAide reads the ISDroid report for Lok it does not
    find this resource in the report and concludes that it is
    is depleted. Unless SWGAide finds a trace of this resource
    at any other planet it is impossible to realize the error. </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Conclusion</b> &ndash; it is always best to cover all ten core planets at
    a time, then SWGAide will find a trace.
    <p> <b>Fix errors</b> &ndash; quickly make the resource available (if it became
      depleted) and <u>remove</u> the resource from the erratic
      planet; notice that remove <i>is not </i> the same as mark
      unavailable. Or, post at the resource forum with info on
      its galaxy, resource class, name, and which is the wrong
      planet. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p><b> Manual submission </b></p>
You can manually submit resource data via a web form at
swgaide.com, this is best supported by the   "planetary"
  output ("long list" is not selected):
  <ul>
    <li> At SWGAide's Main panel, open the "res.txt" notes file;
      select and copy the two lines "swgcraft_start" and
      "swgcraft_end" and all the resources between the two. </li>
    <li> At SWGCraft, <br/>
      &ndash; navigate to "Current Resources" for the correct
      galaxy and planet <br/>
      &ndash; find a text input field at the bottom of the
      planetary page that is named "Add resources for: ..." <br/>
      &ndash; paste into that text field and click "Add Resources" <br/>
      &ndash; verify names, classes, stats, and galaxy/planet and
      click "Add resources". </li>
    <li> Rinse and repeat for each planetary block. </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b> Interplanetary Survey Droids (ISDroids) </b></p>
  <p> This kind of droids are consumables and they do not appear
    in the worlds. They are manufactured by Droid Engineers and
    are sold in factory crates, found at Bazaar &raquo; Misc
    &raquo; Factory&nbsp;crates &raquo; Interplanetary Survey
    Droid. ISdroids cannot be used for Kashyyyk and Mustafar. </p>
  <p> A droid has two qualities: "charges" (uses per droid), and
    "mechanism quality" (response time). An optimal ISDroid has
    10 uses and high "mechanism quality" (~15 minutes and one
    use per planet); a more economical droid has maybe 15 uses
    and ~30 minutes. The trade-off is between uses and response
    time. </p>
  <p> You must have survey devices in your inventory for the
    resource class to survey for; ten devices per class, one
    devices per planet. Such devices are made at a negligible
    cost by the cheapest, or recycled, metal. To cover all ten
    planets and all resource classes you need 50 devices and
    ISDroids with totally 50 uses. When you dispatch a droid
    one use and one survey device is consumed, none of them
    is returned. </p>
  <ul>
    <li> Double click an ISDroid in your inventory </li>
    <li> Select a planet </li>
    <li> Select a survey device </li>
    <li> A system message reads how many minutes until the report
      is returned. </li>
    <li> Rinse and repeat for all resource classes and planets </li>
  </ul>
After the specified time an in-game mail is generated*
and one mail per droid is delivered into your mail-box.
Each mail lists all resources that are in spawn for the
resource class and the planet the report pertains to.
Once all reports have arrived you  <tt> /mailsave </tt>so that SWGAide can find the mails.
  <blockquote> * <i>It is verified that the report is generated at the
    specified time and not at a much later time; it is not
    generated when you log into game to read mails. </i></blockquote>
  <p> <b>Comment</b> &ndash; it is true that ISDroid reports do not read stats
    nor way-points, however, together with SWGAide they are
    highly useful to help you to stay on top with all current
    resources, for all resource classes at the entire galaxy;
    see paragraph on Creature Resources. This means, you will
    always know about new and depleted resources, and you
    can manage your fleet of harvesters most efficiently. </p>
  <br/>
  <p><b> Creature Resources, Kashyyyk, and Mustafar </b></p>
  <p> ISDroids do not cover Creature Resources or the planets
    Kashyyyk and Mustafar. However, SWGAide provides you with
    support also for these resources, see the panel Resources
    &raquo; Submit&nbsp;Resources. At that panel you write a
    filtered output of resources to the "rem.txt" notes file
    and in-game you use the "30k veteran resource crate" to
    determine if they are still in spawn or if you can update
    them; see help text for that panel. </p>
  <br/>
  <HR>
  <br/>
  <p><b> How to "fix" an old resource which is wrongly reported at
    swgaide.com </b></p>
Sometimes a resource is reported with a misspelled name.
Then, if a resource spawns with that name, when and you
try to submit this new resource there is a name clash and
submission fails. The old, faulty resource must be fixed,
partly for its own sake but mainly to make room for the
new resource. Editing a name of an old resource is done
at swgaide.com:
  <ol>
    <li> Use "Find Resources" to find the faulty resource </li>
    <li> Click its name to continue to the page where its details
      are read; there is a link to "edit" the resource. </li>
    <li> Try to find the resource with the help if your "30k Veteran
      Resource Crate"; usually the resource class is correct, or
      almost correct and possible to guess, so skim through the
      resources to find its name, most often only one or a few
      letters are wrong and hence easy to find &gt;&gt;&gt;
      rectify the name. </li>
    <li> Otherwise, rename the erratic resource to something such as
      "Yodaerror", if "Yoda" is the faulty name. Then post at the
      resource and include galaxy, resource class, and what you
      changed the name to; now other players can chime in.
      Mention also the new (the old faulty) name for reference. </li>
    <li> Now you can submit the new, correct resource. </li>
  </ol>
If there is any other problems with old or new resources,
post at the resource forum so that players, moderators, or
administrators can pitch in to help; always be as detailed
as possible.
  </p>
