<h1>Help - Resource Inventory</h1>
<p><b>Note:</b> Account activation and verification required with swgaide.com before inventory functions can be unlocked.</p>
<p> The panel named "Inventory" displays a list of resources in stock for the
  assignees at the current galaxy. It is possible to filter the list on an
  assignee, resource class, or stats. </p>
<p> <b>Resource name: </b>this column reads in three fashions:
<DIV ALIGN="LEFT">
  <UL>
    <li> Plain name; the origin of the resource is known, the current galaxy. </li>
    <li> The name preceded by a bracketed "foreign" galaxy name; the origin of the 
      resource is known, the specified galaxy, for example (Ahazi)Gaia. </li>
    <li> The name is preceded by a bracketed question mark; the origin of the resource is
      unknown, you'd better specify the galaxy promptly. </li>
  </UL>
</DIV>
The two columns "<b>Amount</b>" and "<b>Notes</b>" can always be edited directly
at the table, just double click the table cell. Some other values are edited at
the edit dialog. Currently stats for <I>known</I> resources cannot be edited in
SWGAide but only at swgaide.com, then "edit" the resource in SWGAide and click
"Lookup" and verify that SWGAide obtains the new stats.
</p>
<p> The column named "<b>Rate</b>" shows the rating for resources while using the
  filters at the bottom of this panel. The rating is either based on the specified
  experimental weights, or a general average. The rating is always relative to the
  caps of the resource class which is selected at the drop down list. </p>
<p> <b>Assignee: </b>default is "All". All characters found at the current galaxy are listed,
  this includes all stations found at the computers hard disk. You can also define
  your own assignees.
<BLOCKQUOTE> <b>Add: </b>define a custom assignee to which resources can be assigned <BR/>
  <b>Delete: </b>remove a custom assignee; if the assignee owns resources they are relocated
  to "All" </b> </BLOCKQUOTE>
</p>
<p> <b>Resource class: </b>filter by class </p>
<p> <b>Stats: </b>filters by minimum values, <b>or</b> experimental values such as CD=50 and
  OQ=50 so that the sum is 100 or close to it. These filters work as the filters
  at the table of current resources which are explained in that help text. </p>
<p> However, one difference is that these filters displays all resources which meet
  at least one stat of the filter as if "Calc no-stat" is always selected. Another
  difference is that minimum values are not filtered relative caps. </p>
<p> <b>Popup dialog options at the main table: </b></p>
<p> <b>Schematics viewer </b> &ndash; select a resource and open a window that gives
  a quick display of the quality of the resource versus
  schematics that can use it. The viewer has its own
  help text, press F1 when it has focus. </p>
<p> <b>Select schematic use </b> &ndash; select a resource class and also have it selected
  at Schematics: Resource Class Use. At that panel you can see
  which schematics that calls for the resource class by name,
  or which schematics that may use it. If the resource class
  is not a <i>named resource class </i> it is still selected
  at the right-most tree but one the middle list displays the
  first super-class that is a named resource class. </p>
<p> <b>Create/Edit dialog: </b>Type a resource name, or the first few letters, and click <b>Lookup</b> which requests the resource data from swgaide.com. If the resource is found all
  stats are automatically entered, otherwise you must enter them manually. If many
  resources are found for the entered letters, select one of them at the drop down
  list. Specify the amount you have of that resource. Select an assignee at the
  drop down list. Optionally add a note. </p>
<p> <b>Manage &rArr; Find duplicates </b> &ndash; display all duplicate entries at the main table.
  If no duplicates exist this option is disabled. </p>
<p> <b>Manage &rArr; Merge duplicates to NN </b> &ndash; select a resource entry and select this option to
  merge all duplicates to the assignee of the selected entry.
  If no entry is selected the target is assumed as "All".
  If the target does not own a duplicate resource a new entry
  is added, otherwise the amount is adjusted for the existing
  entry; if several duplicates exist the amount of each is
  added to the entry of the target.
  If no duplicates exist this option is disabled. </p>
<p> <b>Manage &rArr; Move from NN... </b> &ndash; optionally filter the display, select a resource
  entry, and select this option for another dialog at which
  you select a target assignee. The selected resource entry
  determines the from-assignee; all visible resource entries
  owned by this assignee are moved to the selected target,
  hence filters for assignee, resource classes, or resource
  stats apply. If the target already owns a resource its
  amount is updated. </p>
<p> <b>Create guard: </b> select a resource entry and create a guard which has
  its values preset based on the selected resource. Erase any
  unwanted values and save the guard. This option creates a
  plain guard unless you edit the values to become a weighed
  guard. See help text at page <i>Current Resources, Guards </i> for information on guards. </p>
<p> <b>Creature harvesting </b> &ndash; select a creature resource class and this option
  displays two sub-options: <br/>
  <b>Harvested from...</b> which displays a dialog that lists
  the creatures that the class may be harvested from, if any.
  Egg and Seafood are not supported because they are harvested
  wherever. <br/>
  <b>Browse SWGPets.com</b> which opens your web browser for
  the selected resource class. Notice that for generic resource
  classes SWGPets displays all creatures.</p>
<p> <b>Notes import/update... </b> import from an in-game notes file for the character <u>who is selected at the Main panel</u>; this option is
  also used to <b>update existing entries</b> in inventory.
  In-game, type minimal information to a notes file and import
  the notes. For each entry SWGAide either adds, updates, or
  ignores the resource (for "update", see below on how to
  specify amount): </p>
<blockquote> &mdash; If the import <i>is not </i> an "update" and if the
  selected character does not own the resource it is added as
  an entry for the character. If necessary SWGAide tries to
  look it up at swgaide.com, using the specified name +
  current or specified galaxy; if it is unknown at SWGCraft
  it is disregarded and displayed at a final dialog.<br/>
  <p> &mdash; If the import <i>is </i> an "update" SWGAide does
    its best to update the entry for the proper assignee, but
    remember that it imports/updates for the selected character.
  <ol>
    <li> if the a previous entry does not exist it is added to the
      selected character </li>
    <li> else if the selected character owns an entry of the resource
      it is updated </li>
    <li> else if <b>one</b> previous entry exists it is updated no
      matter the owner </li>
    <li> else an undefined entry is updated no matter the owner </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p> This notes file must only contain lines for the resources, you'd
    better dedicate a file only for this purpose. It must have the following syntax:
  <PRE>(galaxy)resourceName,amount,optional notes</PRE>
  If no galaxy is specified SWGAide <U>assumes the current galaxy</U> (galaxy can
  be abbreviated). Amount and notes are optional. However, amount accepts special
  signs that may <b>update but not replace</b> an existing entry in the inventory,
  these
  signs for amount are =, +, or - :
  <div align="left">
    <ul>
      <li><tt>= </tt>the equal sign, replace the
        amount in the old entry</li>
      <li><tt>+ </tt>the plus sign, add the
        amount in the notes file to the old entry</li>
      <li><tt>- </tt>the minus sign, subtract the
        amount in the notes file from the old entry</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  If the resource does not exist in the inventory for
  the selected character the signs have no effect but the entry in the file is
  added to the inventory. Examples with names that conveys the idea:
  </p>
  <blockquote> (Ahazi)Importedwood, 950000, bulk wood<br/>
    Newfrommygalaxy, +225000, here + = or nothing is the same<br/>
    Boughtmore, +250000, add 250k to what I have<br/>
    rectifyinventory, =1000000, rectify inventory<br/>
    drainedinfactory, -75000, used 75k in factory</blockquote>
  <p> <i>Limitation </i> &ndash; the misc-notes part are not
    updated for existing entries, just the amount. </p>
  <p> <b>Notes export... </b> writes the current display to an in-game notes file. You are
    prompted to select an existing notes file and to that file is
    written all the resources which meet the current filters, or
    all entries if no filter is applied. The output format equals
    the format for importing from notes file, hence you can edit
    the amount, see the above options, and add new entries. </p>
  <p> <i>Limitation </i> &ndash; for each entry this option writes
    only the first line of the misc-notes, if any. This is because
    multi-line notes is not supported for the in-game notes file,
    only while exporting/importing from file. Also, the notes are
    not updated for existing entries, just the amount (if you are
    using the signs + - or = as is described above). </p>
  <p> <b>Galaxy copy: </b>select a galaxy to which to copy the current resource
    inventory; only galaxies that are visible at the Main view
    are listed. Then this feature copies to an assignee that is
    named as the current galaxy so that you can find the copied
    the easier. Switch to that galaxy to edit, merge and/or
    delete resources. <b>Notice:</b> If the target assignee already owns a certain resource that
    entry is not modified, but if any other assignee owns that
    resource it exists as two entries, one for each assignee. </p>
  <p> <b>Delete all: </b>remove all resources from the inventory. This option removes only the
    visible entries, that is, if the view is filtered by an assignee then only
    resources for that assignee are removed. This is true for any combination of
    the filters. </p>
  <p> <b>Delete entry: </b>remove the selected entry from the inventory. </p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Galaxy-Transfered Resources </b> </p>
  <p> SWGAide's displays resource names exactly as in SWG; that
    is, a resource that originates from the current galaxy just
    reads its plain name, but the name of a galaxy-transferred
    resource reads the galaxy and the resource name, such as
    "(Ahazi)Longago".</p>
  <p> See below for how export to file works, you may need to
    adjust resource names in the file when you transfer from
    one galaxy to the other, <u>or you simply use the option
    for "Galaxy copy"</u>. </p>
  <p> Resources of unknown origin is firmly advised against
    and you better correct this promptly. The Edit dialog does not support unknown
    galaxies in an attempt to avoid mishaps. How to fix this the easiest way then? <u>The best way</u> is to properly add the resource at swgaide.com (there is a
    special web page to submit old resources) and then create an entry as usual.
    Or...
  <OL>
    <li> Export the inventory to file, no filter applied </li>
    <li> Make a backup copy of the file </li>
    <li> Open the file in any text editor </li>
    <li> Replace all question marks with the correct galaxy name (or its 
      abbreviation) </li>
    <li> Verify that all resources are assigned to their appropriate galaxy </li>
    <li>Save the file as text file </li>
    <li> In SWGAide, delete the inventory, all of it </li>
    <li> Import the edited file </li>
  </OL>
  <p> However, when SWGAide <b>imports from notes file</b> and <b>no galaxy</b> is
    specified there is an important difference from the above, then SWGAide <U>assumes the current galaxy</U> as the origin. Thus, when you write the
    in-game notes file, type the resource name exactly as it reads at the in-game
    examine screen, galaxy name included just if there is any. </p>

<h2>CSV Restore</h2>
<p>SWGAide can restore your inventory from a CSV backup. The file is a comma delimited text file (CSV), the header is prepended by a hash # ... The header and columns are very important if you have modified this file on your own it needs to be what SWGAide expects in a normal CSV backup. All columns must be present even if they are empty values. The ID classToken, and CPUvalues are not needed if you are adding your own resources, empty values can be used for these.</p>
