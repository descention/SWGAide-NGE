  <p><b> Help: Schematics &mdash; Resource Class Use </b></p>
  <br/>
  <p> This panel presents you with resource class usage. For a
    selected profession or schematic this panel displays all
    resource classes that are called for by name, and all the
    sub-classes that can be used for such a required resource
    class. Also the other way around, for a selected resource
    class this panel displays all schematics in which it can
    be used. </p>
  <p> Schematic data are obtained from <nobr><b>swgaide.com</b></nobr>, information that is
    submitted and updated by players like you and me. </p>
  <br/>
  <blockquote>
    <p> When &mdash; not if but when &mdash; you find anything to add,
      complement, or correct, post it in the forums at <nobr><font color="blue"> https://swgaide.com/</font></nobr>.
      Or add a note to the comment field at the schematic's web page
      at SWGCraft. Or, even better, post an application to become a <i>schematics maintainer </i> to help the community in SWG. </p>
    <p> In SWGAide, often a mouse right-click at a GUI element displays
      a popup dialog with various options and features. </p>

  <p> <b>Resource Class Use </b> </p>
  <p> This panel contains five elements which are updated when you
    select one thing or the other. They are a profession chooser,
    a list of schematics, a weight display, a list of resource
    classes, and a tree of resource classes. The following text
    describes them in order of use, not their position. </p>
  <p> <b>Profession Chooser: </b><br/>
    Select the profession of interest; this updates the list
    and the tree of resource classes, see details further down. 
    Or select "All" for all resource classes. If you at another
    element select something that filters the display, press the
    button next to this chooser, or press Alt-X, to <b>reset</b> to the selected profession and the display. </p>
  <p> <b>Notice:</b> resource classes are <i>not listed </i> for schematics with <b> UNKNOWN </b> profession level. That is, if nobody has reported either
    profession or level to swgaide.com then SWGAide should not
    wrongly list resource classes that a profession cannot use. </p>
  <p> <b>Resource Classes called for by name: </b><br/>
    The center list display all those resource classes which
    at least one schematic calls for by name. This list displays
    only the <i>required </i> resource classes, not sub-classes
    that are possible to use in the place of the class that is
    called for. Of course, sub-classes which are called for by
    name are listed. The list is sorted in the same order as the
    resource classes are usually listed in SWGAide. </p>
  <p> As an alert, if a resource class is missing in your resource
    inventory it is displayed at a colored background. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <b><i>Required resource class</i></b>, this is the class that
      a schematic calls for. For example, if a schematic calls for
      Metal, then Metal is the <i>required </i> resource class. The
      schematic's resource slot accepts any kind of metal you have
      at hand, but Metal is the <i>required </i> resource class and
      Metal sets the rules for caps and the math for this resource
      slot while crafting. </p>
    <p> <b><i>Named resource class</i></b>, this term denotes a 
      resource class that spawns in the worlds. The resource classes
      of the resources you harvest have specific class names, but a
      generic resource class denotes a group of several sub-classes
      which are yet another less generic class or a named class. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>Resource Classes... &mdash; Popup dialog: </b> </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Filter inventory </b> &ndash; filters the resource inventory for the selected
    resource class.
    <p> <b>Filter current </b> &ndash; filters the table of currently spawning resources
      for the selected resource class. </p>
    <p> <b>Plain guard... </b> &ndash; creates a plain guard that alerts whenever the
      specified resource class spawns. The new guard is named "Any
      spawn" and it is set to OQ = 1 &ndash; such a guard alerts
      whenever the resource class spawns, no matter the quality.
      If a similar guard exist you are notified and can abort.
      Its notes is initiated with a few of the listed schematics. </p>
    <p> <b>Quality guard... </b> &ndash; opens the usual dialog for creating resource guards
      and with some values pre-filled. For the selected resource
      class, if the listed schematics provides for more than one
      weight-entry SWGAide selects one at random. Hence, you may
      have to edit the dialog for the schematic of interest. This
      also means that if the option is selected to disable this
      option if matching guards exist then this option may wrongly
      be disabled; first,
      try to select a schematic to narrow the possibilities,
      otherwise disable the other option temporarily. </p>
    <p> <b>Disable guard menu </b> &ndash; select this option to disable guard menus if an
      identical guard already exist; this is default. This option
      affects the options for both plain and quality guards; see
      above for details on a limitation in this feature where it
      may wrongly disable the option for quality guards. </p>
    <p> <b>Write to file </b> &ndash; writes the names of required resource classes to file.
      All resource classes that are displayed at at the center list
      are written to file; disabled if "All" is selected. The file
      is named after the selected profession and is put into the 
      "crafting" folder, for example <br/>
      <tt> [SWGAide]\crafting\Entertainer_res_class_use.txt </tt> </p>

  <p> <b>Resource Class Tree: </b><br/>
    To the right is a tree of resource classes which displays not
    only those classes which are called for by name but also all
    the sub-classes that the can be used for a required class. <font color="blue"><b> Blue text </b></font> denotes required resource classes. </p>
  <p> <b>Resource Class Tree &mdash; Popup dialog: </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Filter inventory </b> &ndash; filters the resource inventory for the selected
    resource class.
    <p> <b>Filter current </b> &ndash; filters the table of currently spawning resources for
      the selected resource class. </p>
    <p> <b>More schematics </b> &ndash; toggles an option to display schematics that <i>can
      use </i> a selected resource class, rather than just the 
      schematics that call for a selected resource class by name.
      Even if this option is turned off (default) you can see which
      resource classes that can be used, those under any blue node.
      With this option on, when you select a non-blue node the
      closest named resource class is selected at the center list. </p>
    <p> <b>Collapse/Expand tree </b> &ndash; toggles an option to limit the size of the resource
      class tree for the current session. This just affects the
      visual display and does not affect any logic. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>Schematics: </b><br/>
    The left-hand list displays a list of schematics. <br/>
    Select a resource class at the center list or at the tree
    to populate this list with those schematics that call for
    the selected resource class by name. </p>
  <p> Select a schematic at this list to display only those
    resource classes that the schematic calls for by name. This
    updates the list and the tree of resource classes. This also
    updates the field for experimental weights; a schematic which
    is tagged as low-quality reads "n/a", otherwise its
    experimental weights are displayed. </p>
  <p> <b>Schematics &mdash; Popup dialog: </b> </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Select schematic</b> &ndash; use this option to select the current schematic at
    other GUI panels as a convenience. This overrides but does
    not modify possible filters that would hinder the display.
    If <i>Always select </i> at the Options menu is enabled
    there is no need to invoke this option.
    <p> <b>Only HQ/LQ or All </b> &ndash; select one of the options to filter the list of
      schematics that are displayed for a selected resource class,
      default is "All". This option is for the current session,
      and it affects only the list of schematics. Notice that as
      LQ counts any schematic that is tagged as LQ or is without
      experimenting properties, otherwise, if its quality level
      is HQ, mixed, or unknown it counts as HQ. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>Experimental Weights: </b><br/>
    Bottom left is an element that displays the variations of
    experimental weights for the selected schematic. They are
    listed in the order they are read at a schematic, not by
    any other preference such as order of importance. </p>
