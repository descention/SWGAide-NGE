SWGAide prides itself with quite a good help system, but Zimoon only
speaks Swedish and English. To overcome this limitation features are
added to SWGAide to support for any language. To begin with only the
help texts are supported, more will come over time.

This file reads the rules for translated help files.



General Info
============

It is of course good that You are familiar with SWGAide and how it
is thought to work. If you are uncertain of a feature, ask first and
translate second. Probably the confusion is an indication that my
English needs to be improved.

It is OK to translate just one file or one at a time over a period.
At the forum at swgaide.com, communicate what you are doing to avoid
double work with other players.

Do not change the HTML tags in the files, just translate the text in
a fashion you find most user friendly. The HTML tags may be replaced
by machine scripts, hence they must look as is.

You can add comments in English for future maintainers. Use the HTML
tag <!-- your comment /Zimoon --> for this.



Original Files Names - Information
==================================

File names must always be lower case.
See next section on how to map file names to the visible text.

Examples:
help_schematics__en.html
help_schematics_laboratory_en.html
help_schematics_many_words_for_sub_feature_en.html

The first part tells the context, if it is "help", "info", or
anything else.

The second part tells the major feature, such "schematics". The
sub-features are grouped under he main feature.

The third part tells the minor feature, for example "laboratory".

The _xx language part tells the language.

File names for the translated text MUST BE IDENTICAL with their
English counterparts, only the language code is changed;
for example English to French:
help_schematics__en.html
help_schematics__fr.html

You must include a index_xx.txt file for the mapping between file
name and the title for the HTML index file that SWGAide creates.
Inside SWGAide your translated file is used as is, the help system
does not use the index_xx.txt file, but the outside files in the
docs folder do.



Initiate -- Engage -- Finish
============================

A) Announce your intent at SWGAide's forum at swgaide.com

B) You will work with three files at a time:
   1) The original English file
   2) Your translated file
   3) a file named index_xx.txt which is described soon

C) If there is a change to the original file while you are 
   translating we will communicate the changed text to you, this
   means that you must announce what you are doing at SWGAide's
   forum at swgaide.com, otherwise we cannot tell you.

D) Send the translated file and the index_xx.txt file to Zimoon. 



The index_xx.txt
================

You must provide a file named index_xx.txt, where xx is a
language code. This file maps file names to titles, and it
is written on the format:

#file_name_xx.html                    Title
help_schematics__en.html              Schematics
help_schematics_laboratory_en.html    The Laboratory
help_schematics_a_b_c_d_en.html       A Silly Example

Each mapping on its own line.
The first white space is the delimiter, it can be one or several.
This is a plain text file, not a word document.

The file should also have a mapping for the title and language:
main_title      Index of Help Files &mdash; English

For a comment in this file, begin the line with a dash, such as
# this is a comment anywhere in the file and it is ignored
# empty lines are also OK

In the index_xx.txt file, sub-features are grouped under the
main feature. Hence the titles of sub-features must not read
"Schematics -- The Laboratory" but just "The Laboratory".
