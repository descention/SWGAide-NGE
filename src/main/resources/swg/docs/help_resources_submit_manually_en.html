<h1>Help - Submit Resources </h1>
<br>
<br>
<p> This section of SWGAide presents you with a feature
  to easily submit a single resource, or to submit several
  resources in a semiautomated fashion which useful for the
  players who manually update swgaide.com with for example
  creature resources. No copy & paste, just a few mouse clicks
  plus editing an in-game notes file. </p>
<p> With the feature for multi-submit you can write a set of
  resources to an in-game notes file named "rem.txt". Then, in
  game, you look them up with for example a 30k resource crate
  to see if there is any action required, see further down. The
  output <i>always includes </i> stat-less resources, no matter
  their age but possibly filtered on resource class or planet. </p>
<br>
<p><b>Mandatory resource classes </b> &mdash; these are resource classes that are always in spawn
  in SWG; each of these classes always has one and only one
  resource in spawn; they are: </p>
<ul>
  <li>all of Organic</li>
  <li>all Fiberplast</li>
  <li>all JTL</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  Organic and Fiberplast are also planetary and SWGAide
  automatically selects the correct planet. When you submit
  mandatory resources to SWGCraft the older counterparts are
  automatically marked as unavailable. </p>
<p> For the resource class or planet that is filtered for,
  if mandatory resources are missing at swgaide.com they are
  always written to the notes file. </p>
<p> Summary: the resource-class/planet and the age filters
  allow you to focus on a small, manageable set of resources
  and only if you find that a resource is new, replaced, or 
  depleted you need take action.
  &mdash; This text is referred to later in this document. </p>
<br>
<h2>Single input / Edit</h2>
<p> The upper panel has two distinct functions: <br>
  1 &mdash; <b>submit</b> a single resource to swgaide.com <br>
  2 &mdash; <b>edit</b> an entry that is selected at the list
  of multiple resources; assuming that you have loaded a notes
  file. </p>
<p> The input fields for <b>planets</b> and for <b>resource
  class</b> support <b>abbreviated input</b> and the result
  is displayed just under the input fields. </p>
<p> <b>Resource names</b> requires you to be careful, a spelling
  error will block a future submission to swgaide.com for that
  name ... until it is corrected by the moderators. </p>
<p> <b>Stats</b> are optional, you can submit a resource without
  stats and complement the resource later on; it is better to
  submit without stats than not or several hours later. Type
  only the stats which are displayed in-game and in the same
  order as you read them. When a resource class is selected
  the expected stats are displayed under the input field.
  Errors are displayed in red above the input fields, usual
  errors are: values outside the caps for the resource class,
  too few or too many values, or input that is not a number. </p>
<p> Once resource data are entered and no error is displayed,
  click <b>Submit</b> to upload the single resource to
  swgaide.com; see a later paragraph on similar names.<br>
  If you rather are <u>editing</u> an entry that you selected
  at the list of multiple resources this button is named <b>Apply</b>. </p>
<br>
<h2> <b>Multiple resources </b></h2>
<p> The center and bottom section of this panel are used for
  submitting a batch of several resources. For this feature
  you create an in-game notes file named "rem.txt" which you
  update in-game. First a walk-through: </p>
<br>
<p> <b>1 &mdash; Prepare the notes file </b> </p>
<p> a &ndash; <b>Filter on</b> resource class, planet, or
  stat-less to narrow down the set of resources to handle.
  The stat-less filter writes all resources that are listed at
  swgaide.com without stats. </p>
<p> b &ndash; <b>Limit on age</b> to narrow the set even more.
  Default age is 6 days which is the minimum lifetime for all
  resources in SWG, except that JTL resources are 13 days.
  Default is fine for all mandatory resources but for all other
  classes you may want to use 0 days to be able to see what is
  reported and what is not. </p>
<p> c &ndash; <b>Write to "rem.txt"</b> for in-game editing. If
  the notes file is not empty a dialog displays with the options
  to Erase, Append, or Cancel. The option to Append makes it
  possible to apply one filter after the other and append to
  the file. Resources are written to the file in the same order
  as their resource classes are listed in the 30k resource
  crate to make it the easier to look them up. </p>
<br>
<p> <b>2 &mdash; In-game, edit the notes file </b> </p>
<p> This far you have a notes file that is named "rem.txt".
  The file contains current, missing, and so called stat-less
  resources; they have three different looks:
<pre>
     Resourcename , Resource Class, (age, nbr of days)
     Resourcename , Resource Class, add-stats
      , Resource Class, 
</pre>
</p>
<p> &mdash; the first look is for current resources and it reads
  their age; find out if they are replaced <br>
  &mdash; the second look is for resources which are reported
  without stats; add stats if you can <br>
  &mdash; the third look is for mandatory resources where none
  is listed at SWGCraft; add the resource if you can </p>
<p> a &mdash; <b>Open</b> the notes file with the command <tt>/notes rem </tt>&mdash;
  notice that you must not type the file suffix ".txt",
  otherwise you creates a file named "rem.txt.txt".
  The header of the notes file reads today's date and a brief
  help text, do not edit this header.
  These are the possible actions: </p>
<p> b &mdash; <b>Verify</b> that the header of the notes file
  reads today's date. If you need it also reads a brief help
  text. Do not edit this header. </p>
<p> c &mdash; <b>Edit</b> the notes file; while looking up the
  resources you will find that these are the possible actions
  (lookup is easiest via a 30k resource crate): </p>
<dl>
  <dt> <b>Unchanged resources</b> </dt>
  <dd> no action required, leave them as-is, SWGAide ignores these
    &mdash; this is the most common case </dd>
  <dt> <b>Replaced resources</b> </dt>
  <dd> replace the name and add stats but leave the resource class
    &mdash; <i>only mandatory resource classes are replaced</i>,
    all other classes are either new or depleted </dd>
  <dt> <b>Missing resource classes</b> </dt>
  <dd> add name and add stats but leave the resource class </dd>
  <dt> <b>New resources</b> </dt>
  <dd> at a new line you add name, resource class, and stats
    &mdash; the format is <br>
    <tt>planet1, planet2, name, resource class, stats </tt> </dd>
  <dt> <b>Depleted resources</b> </dt>
  <dd> type<tt> "depl," </tt>just before the resource name,
    without quotes &mdash; for mandatory resources, see above </dd>
  <dt> <b>Stat-less resources</b> </dt>
  <dd> replace "add-stats" with the stats </dd>
  <dt> <b>Rectify resource stats</b> </dt>
  <dd> erase the age and add the stats; leave resource name and
    class as-is </dd>
  <dt> <b>Rectify resource name</b> </dt>
  <dd> specify the correct name together with the old name
    &mdash; the format is (notice the two = signs)<br>
    =<tt>oldname</tt>=<tt>correctname</tt><br>
    If the difference in names is to large SWGAide ignores the
    suggested name, you must correct this at swgaide.com. </dd>
</dl>
<p> For your convenience SWGAide supports the delimiters<tt> " .,:;" </tt>(quotes excluded) but between name and resource
  class you <b><i>must use </i></b> a comma sign. </p>
<p> d &mdash; <b>Close</b> the in-game notes editor so that the
  file is saved to disk. If you leave the editor open and read
  or edit it outside SWG the outcome is undefined and the data
  is lost or corrupt. </p>
<p> Remember that SWGAide supports abbreviated input for planet
  names and resource classes, that planets of planetary resources
  are automatically handled, and that resource names are properly
  capitalized by SWGAide. </p>
<p> <b>Examples</b> of valid input lines:
<pre>
    Corellia Rori Yavin, Amaraz, Lubricating Oil, 789 963
    c, r, y, amaraz, lu oil, 789 963
    Evilsoup, dat wa, 987 456
    evilSOUP, dat wa, 987     456
    depl, Restinpeace, Colat Iron, 9
    depl, restinpeace
</pre>
</p>
The first two entries equal each other in spite of the
abbreviations of the second. The third entry is a Dathomir
Water Vapor which is planetary, hence the planet may be
omitted; notice that upper or lower case is corrected by
SWGAide. The last entries are for a depleted resource, the
word "depl, " is prepended to the entry and anything after
the resource name is ignored; tips: if possible, re-use the
resource class for a new resource.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> <b>3 &mdash; Back in SWGAide, load notes file </b> </p>
<p> By now you have updated some resources of the notes file
  and you want to submit them to swgaide.com. </p>
<p> a &mdash; <b>Load from "rem.txt"</b> to populate the main
  panel with the added and edited resources. All unchanged
  resources are ignored and are not displayed. </p>
<p> b &mdash; <b>Verify</b> the entries for correctness; these
  are the colors that are used at this panel: </p>
<table border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="3" bgcolor="silver">
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="White"> White </td>
    <td bgcolor="White"> Valid resource data </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#ffdfdf"> Red </td>
    <td bgcolor="#ffdfdf"> An error, displayed as-is </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#ffffbf"> Yellow </td>
    <td bgcolor="#ffffbf"> No stats (stats are optional) </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td bgcolor="#bfbfff"> Blue </td>
    <td bgcolor="#bfbfff"> Depleted </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p> c &mdash; <b>Edit</b> any entry; just click the line to
  select it and its content populates the fields at the upper
  panel. Edit the content until it is correct, then click <b> Apply</b>, the secondary form of the upper submit button. </p>
<p> d &mdash; <b>To delete</b> an entry (optional) you select a
  line and right click it, at the popup dialog you select the
  option to delete the entry. Editing or deleting an entry <i>does not </i> affect the notes file but just the display
  and what is submitted to swgaide.com, or not. To undo the
  edits, just load the notes file again. </p>
<p> e &mdash; <b>Reload</b> the notes file to undo any edits or
  deletions you may have done. Nothing of the above modifies
  the in-game notes file, hence, press the load-button to load
  it once again. This also makes it possible to again edit the
  notes file in-game, for example to add or correct something. </p>
<p> f &mdash; <b>Submit</b> all resources by clicking the
  Submit button at the lower, right-hand side. The process is
  displayed at SWGAide's status bar and when the entries at
  the list turns gray; see a later paragraph on similar names. </p>
<p> g &mdash; <b>Verify</b> at swgaide.com that the submission
  was a success. </p>
<br>
<br>
<b>Similar resource names &mdash; Dialog</b>
</p>
<p> To avoid that you submit resources that double those that
  already are listed at swgaide.com SWGAide determines how
  similar the names of your resources are with all other
  resources. Equal names are already handled but a spelling
  error is so easily done, either by you or another player.
  If such names are found SWGAide displays a dialog with some
  options. </p>
<p> If a resource is similar to many other resources you see a <b>cluster</b> of your resource and those it mimics. Then <i>review all </i> alerts in that cluster before you decide
  how to proceed. </p>
<p> Both single and clustered resources have two buttons per
  entry, to send your resource or send a name correction, and
  you can of course decide to do nothing. </p>
<p> <b>Submit new</b> &mdash; press this button to send your resource as is;
  this is when when SWGAide displays a false alert, your
  resource and the other resource are not the same ... see
  below. If your resource is in a cluster, review all alerts
  before you decide how to proceed. </p>
<p> <b>Submit name</b> &mdash; press this button to edit the name of the older
  resource to the name of your resource; this is when the
  older resource is correct except for its name - both your
  and the older resource must be identical except for the
  names. If the opposite is true, your resource is wrong and
  the existing is correct, do nothing. If your resource is in
  a cluster, review all alerts before you decide how to
  proceed. </p>
<p> Other error types are not handled by this dialog. To edit
  the stats of a resource you just send it with the correct
  values and this dialog is never used (assuming that the
  name is correct).
  If the resource class is in error, currently SWGAide does
  not support this edit but you must visit SWGCraft.
  If planets are in error, this must always be reported at
  the resource forum at SWGCraft. </p>
<p> <b>False alarms</b> &mdash; the algorithm to determine if names are similar
  is called the Levenshtein distance; it is quite simple and
  measures how many edits it takes to change one name to the
  other, the edits being replace, add, or erase. Thus, it is
  a fair risk for false alarms every now and then, certainly
  so for the shorter names. Should SWGAide really test name
  similarities also against other resource classes?
  Maybe, maybe not; please report your experience so that we
  can improve the logic. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p> <b>Tips: </b><br>
  Use the <b>30k resource deed</b> which is a 6 months veteran
  reward. Per resource class the most recent resource is listed
  bottommost, which makes it easy to determine if it is a new
  name or not (rarely the crate displays the name topmost, but
  just for the session; a bug of some kind). Select a resource
  and the crate reads its stats at the next screen. After this
  screen it comes a confirmation screen, hence, those scary
  moments of the past, while reading the stats, are history. </p>
<p> The resources are written to the in-game notes file in the
  same order as resource classes are listed in the 30k deed,
  credits to Rommel. This makes it most convenient to lookup
  resources while walking through the notes file. </p>
<br>
<p> <b>Misc: </b></p>
<p> a &mdash; 
  This panel supports a black-list for resource classes you
  never want to manage. In the folder
  <SWGAide>
  \misc you create
  a file which must be named "submit_blacklist.txt". Specify
  resource classes, each at a line by itself, for example:
<pre>
    Seafood
    Horn
    Egg
</pre>
</p>
<p> b &mdash;
  Another option; if you want to manage resources which are
  not possible to harvest naturally then right click the main
  panel and select "Allow non-harvestable". These resources
  can only be obtained by popping a 30k resource crate. </p>
