  <p><b> Help: Schematics &mdash; Today's Alert </b></p>
  <br/>
  <p> This panel helps you to quickly review currently spawning
    resources that are better than what exists in your resource
    inventory. SWGAide scans current resources which are not yet
    harvested and computes their experimental weights which are
    compared versus your resource inventory. In low-quality mode
    this panel displays resources for classes that are missing
    in inventory. </p>
  <p> This panel <i>does not </i> replace resource guards at the
    Resources panel. Guards alert you when a resource meets its
    criterion, whether high or low, and they automatically check
    for news at your main galaxy at swgaide.com. This panel,
    for your assignees and their lists of favorite schematics
    it displays which resources that are better than your stock.
    Or you select to do this for all schematics or for a
    selected profession. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> Schematic data are mainly obtained from <nobr><b>swgaide.com</b></nobr> and all resource data
      are obtained from there. This is the data which are submitted
      and updated by players like you and me. </p>
    <p> The more players that update SWGCraft the better this panel
      supports your crafting; find the ISDroid folder at the mail
      section and also the "Submit Resources" panel for manual
      submission of one or several resource data. See help file
      for <i>Draft Schematics </i> for details on how to update
      or submit schematics. </p>
    <p> In SWGAide, often a mouse right-click at a GUI element displays
      a popup dialog with various options and features. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Today's Alert </b> </p>
  <p> When computing the weights for schematics this panel makes
    use of the resource classes that these schematics call for.
    Thus, computed rates and coloring is done relative the caps
    of the required resource classes. It allows for zero-stats
    but requires at least one stat for the displayed resources.
    See the <i>Beginner's Guide for Traders </i> for a complete
    discussion on how rates are computed for a single resource. </p>
  <p> Limits and colors are the same as for the <i>Resources </i> panel and this panel displays resources with a computed rate
    better than anything in inventory or resources with a rate
    better than the "fair" limit. Specify limits and colors at
    the panel Current Resources &rArr; Display Options.
    For example, set the limit for "fair" to 800 and if nothing
    in inventory meets the schematic then only resources with a
    rate better than 800 are listed, and then 800 is also the
    lower limit for the "fair" color. </p>
  <p> <b>Assignees: </b><br/>
    To the upper left, select an assignee and for its list of
    favorite schematics SWGAide scans the current resources and
    displays those that are better than your resource inventory
    &mdash; define assignees and add favorite schematics either
    at the <i>Manage Assignees and Favorites </i> dialog or at
    the <i>Draft Schematics </i> panel; the dialog is opened at
    the Edit menu and it has its own help text. </p>
  <p> Below the assignees you have created you see more entries.
    If you select "Pro: All" or "Pro:
    <profession>
    " this panel
    rather scans all schematics for the selected item. If you
    are new to SWGAide and inventory is quite empty, then these
    options may display way too much to be useful for you, then
    create one or several assignees and add schematics to their
    list of favorites. On the other hand, if resource inventory
    is well stocked you may prefer these options over assignees
    &mdash; or not. </p>
  <p> <b>Assignees &mdash; Popup menu: </b> </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Manage assignees... </b> &ndash; select this option to open the dialog for managing
    assignees and favorite lists. This dialog is not for other
    features related to schematic assignees.
    <p> <b>Default assignee</b> &ndash; select an entry as a default assignee; when SWGAide
      starts it scans all current resources against the list of
      favorite schematics of this assignee and if a resource is
      found that is better-than-inventory it colors the tabs for
      Schematics and Today's Alert as a notification. If nothing
      is selected SWGAide scans schematics for all professions,
      which equals the "Pro: All" entry. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Options: </b><br/>
    Adjust the limits for which resources to include and what
    inventory stock to consider: </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Max days </b> &ndash; specify maximum age for the resources to display;
    e.g. "2" displays all better-than-inventory resources that
    are reported to swgaide.com within the recent two days.
    This option applies to both HQ and LQ mode.
    <p> <b>Inventory </b> &ndash; specify a limit for which inventory resource crates
      to ignore. For example "50,000" makes SWGAide to ignore any
      crate smaller than 50k when it compares resource rates.
      Hence this option gives an early warning that something soon
      runs out; zero (0) compares against all inventory resources,
      also very small crates. This option only applies to HQ mode. </p>
    <p> <b>HQ / LQ </b> &ndash; switch between high-quality and low-quality mode.<br/>
      &ndash; HQ mode: 
      for each favorite schematic and for its combinations of
      required resource classes and experimental weights, SWGAide
      computes the rates for current and inventory resources; only
      resources with rates equal or better than inventory are
      displayed. <br/>
      &ndash; LQ mode: 
      for each favorite schematic SWGAide checks if its required
      resource classes are missing in inventory. This feature does
      not determine if resources are bulk or superior qualities. </p>
    <p> <b>Show Great </b> &ndash; select this option to ignore inventory and rather
      display all "great" resources. For each schematic of the
      selected assignee or profession and for all its combinations
      of required resource classes and its experimental weights,
      SWGAide computes the rates for all of the current resources
      and displays only resources with rates that are better than
      "great". Define the limit of <i>Great </i> at Resources
      &rarr; Display Options. This option is disabled in LQ mode. </p>
    <p> <b>Ignore K/M </b> &ndash; select to ignore resources from Kashyyyk or Mustafar.
      Notice that this option does not apply to creature resources
      from these two planets. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>Main table: </b><br/>
    This table is populated when you select an assignee so that
    for its list of favorite schematics SWGAide scans all current
    resources and displays the result at this table. If nothing
    outshines your inventory this table is empty. For a resource
    this table reads its rate and its improvement over inventory.
    A resources is displayed per combination of
    resource-class-and-weights that pertains to the resource.
    Thus you may see several entries for the same resource,
    each of its entries is for a discreet combination of
    resource-class and weights. </p>
  <p> <b>Columns and Colors </b> &ndash; for resource values, the rate, and the <i>percent </i> columns the limits and colors are the same as at the <i>Resources </i> panel. The stats that are called for by
    the experimental weights are rendered in bold face. Rates
    are based on the combination of resource class and weights
    of the favorite schematic that the entries pertain to. </p>
  <p> The <nobr>%%</nobr> column displays the estimated improvement
    of current resources versus best of inventory as a percentage.
    Improvements greater than 5% are rendered at a "fair" color,
    above 10% at a "good" color, and greater than 15% at a "great"
    color background. If the resource is for a resource class that
    is missing in inventory the background is cyan to alert you.
    A calculated rate <b>is not</b> the <i>weighed average result</i> because then <i>all resources </i> in a schematic must be calculated together &mdash; this
    topic and the math behind this is discussed in the <i>Beginner's Guide for Traders</i>. </p>
  <p> In LQ mode coloring is based on the classes of the resources
    themselves, without rate because there is no experimenting
    but the <nobr>%%</nobr> column is colored with cyan. </p>
  <p> <b>Main table &mdash; Popup menu: </b> </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Resource details...</b> &ndash: displays a dialog with details about the selected
    resource. The dialog reads details about planets and age,
    and if the resource is already in inventory the total
    amount is included.
    <p> <b>Select current </b> &ndash; selects the spawning resource at the table of current
      resources as a convenience. </p>
    <p> <b>Filter current </b> &ndash; filters table of currently spawning resources for
      the class of the filter and selects the resource for entry. </p>
    <p> <b>Filter inventory </b> &ndash; filters and sorts the resource inventory for
      the weights and class that pertains to the selected entry;
      that is, the resource class of the selected resource and the 
      experimental weights of the filter the resource pertains to. </p>
    <p> <b>Schematics viewer </b> &ndash; select a resources and open a window that gives
      a quick display of the quality of the monitored resource
      versus schematics that can use it. The viewer has its own
      help text, press F1 when it has focus. </p>
    <p> <b>Creature harvesting </b> &ndash; for a selected creature resource class and this
      option displays two sub-options: <br/>
      <b>Harvested from...</b> which displays a dialog that lists
      the creatures that the class may be harvested from, if any.
      Egg and Seafood are not supported because they are harvested
      wherever. <br/>
      <b>Browse SWGPets.com</b> which opens your web browser for
      the selected resource class. Notice that for generic resource
      classes SWGPets displays all creatures. </p>
    <p> <b>Organic vs. Creature Resources </b> &ndash; toggles whether Creature Resources are disregarded
      or not when a schematic calls for Organic; using harvesters
      for Flora Resources is "cheaper" for Organic. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Resource class &amp; weights and best from Inventory: </b><br/>
    Select an entry at the table of current resources and this
    text field displays information that pertains to the selected
    resource: </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Filter </b> &ndash; displays the required resource-class and the weights;
    this is the combination that is used to calculate the rate
    for the selected resource, the class and the weights from one
    or several favorite schematics.
    <p> <b>Inventory </b> &ndash; displays the best resource you have on stock for the
      current resource class and weights. It also displays its total <b>amount</b>. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>Resource class &amp; weights and best from Inventory
    &mdash; Popup menu: </b> </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Filter current </b> &ndash; filters the table of currently spawning resources
    for the resource class of the displayed filter.
    <p><b>Filter inventory </b> &ndash; filters and sorts the resource inventory for the
      displayed filter, i.e. the displayed resource class and
      experimental weights. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Schematics: </b><br/>
    Select an entry at the table of current resources and this
    field displays a list of the schematics which are using the <i>Filter </i> that is displayed at the left-hand text field. </p>
  <p> Select an entry at this list; if the menu option <i>Always
    select </i> is enabled the schematic is selected at other
    GUI panels as a convenience. This overrides but does not
    modify possible filters that would hinder the display. </p>
  <p> <b>Schematics &mdash; Popup menu: </b> </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Select schematic</b> &ndash; use this option to select the current schematic at
    other GUI panels as a convenience. This overrides but does
    not modify possible filters that would hinder the display.
    If <i>Always select </i> at the Options menu is enabled
    there is no need to invoke this option. </blockquote>
