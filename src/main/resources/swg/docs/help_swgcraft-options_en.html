  <p> <b>Main galaxy: </b>the default galaxy which is preselected at panels related 
    to crafting, unless the current character is from another galaxy. </p>
  <p> <b>Auto-update: </b>if this option is selected SWGAide automatically downloads 
    resource data for the main galaxy. </p>
  <p> <b>Time zone: </b>your time zone relative to the international GMT (UTC). 
    Daylight saving is unsupported. </p>
  <p> <b>User name and password: </b>your login details to swgaide.com.  </p>
  <p> <b>Verify: </b>validates the entered username/password before saving them 
    locally. An invalid username and/or password makes many crafting related 
    features of SWGAide unusable. </p>
  <p> <b>Save: </b>the user name and password are the only data which you must save 
    manually. </p>
  <p> <b>SWGCraft data: </b>Details for communicating with the server. These details 
    are locked and cannot be edited unless the check-box is ticked.
  <OL>
    <LI> The "base URL" to the server, the initial part of the link. </LI>
    <LI> The "resource path" is the specific path to the file for exported resource data.
      The "%BASE%" and "%GALAXY%.xml.gz" are filled in by SWGAide but the rest can be 
      edited if ever necessary. </LI>
    <LI> The "status file" is the tiny file at the server that reads the most recent date
      the exported data files were updated. This file is always checked against to 
      avoid excess downloads of the export files. </LI>
    <LI> SOAP is the path pointing to the SOAP server utilized by SWGAide to communicate 
      resource data with swgaide.com. </LI>
  </OL>
  Normally you should not have to touch these server settings and they are 
  "locked" to prevent accidental data corruption.
  </p>
  <p> If you completely erase the content of any of these fields it will reset to its 
    default value when you restart SWGAide. </p>
