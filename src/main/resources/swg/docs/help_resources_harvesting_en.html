  <p><b> Help - Harvesting </b></p>
  <br/>
  <p> The panel named "Harvesting" helps you to monitor several
    active harvesters; they will alert you when harvesters run
    out of maintenance, power, or is soon full, and when the
    harvested resource is depleted. Harvested resources are
    added to inventory. </p>
  <p> In order to use these features you must first define one or
    several harvesters and at least one owner; see tips further
    down. To begin monitoring, at the "Current Resources" you
    select the wanted resource, right-click it and select the
    option "Add to harvester panel" at the popup dialog. </p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p><b> Harvesters: </b><br/>
    The upper leftmost table displays your defined harvesters.
    To add a new harvester, right-click inside the table and
    select to create or possibly clone a harvester. Define its
    properties: name, harvester type, BER, and hopper size. Of
    a defined harvester, only its name can be edited; this is
    the same as for in-game harvesters. </p>
  <p> <b>Harvesters &mdash; Popup menu: </b><br/>
    The popup menu for the this table provides options that are
    related to harvesters: </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Create harvester</b> &ndash; define a harvester for the current galaxy. <b>Tips:</b> you do not need to create as many harvesters
    as you usually put down on a resource; you rather want to
    use the feature for "Harvester Cluster" at the "Activate
    Harvester" dialog; see below.
    <p> <b>Edit harvester</b> &ndash; edit the name/description of a harvester. </p>
    <p> <b>Clone harvester</b> &ndash; define a harvester for the current galaxy but copy
      all values from a selected harvester. Make its description
      unique. </p>
    <p> <b>Export</b> &ndash; write harvesters and owners for the current galaxy
      to file, the two are merged to the same file. Use this to
      backup your definitions, or to transfer them to some other
      galaxy or installation of SWGAide. </p>
    <p> <b>Import file</b> /ndash; import harvesters and owners to the current galaxy
      from file. Any entry with a name that equals an existing
      entry is silently ignored. </p>
    <p> <b>Delete harvester</b> &ndash; delete a selected harvester; this action cannot be
      undone. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>Harvesters &mdash; Create &amp; Edit dialog: </b><br/>
    The dialogs for creating, cloning, and editing harvesters
    basically provides the same options, but some are disabled: </p>
  <blockquote> <b> Harvester description</b> &ndash; a unique name or text that describes each harvester.
    Examples: "Elite Mineral - 1" and "Elite Mineral - 2".
    <p><b> Harvester type</b> &ndash; this value automatically defines certain properties,
      such as maintenance rates, power consumption, and for which
      resource classes the harvester is listed at the activation
      dialog. </p>
    <p><b> Harvester BER</b> &ndash; the base extraction rate of the harvester. This is
      the un-buffed value, as it reads at the deed. </p>
    <p><b> Hopper size</b> &ndash; the basic hopper size of the harvester. This is the
      un-buffed value, as it reads at the deed. <b>Tip:</b> do not
      up this value, rather round off downwards; this way alerts
      for full hopper are not delayed. </p>
    <p><b> Extraction Modifier</b> &ndash; the resource extraction rate modifier for your server. This modifier is used in the calculation of UBER and AER which controls how fast your hopper fills up. This function was added to accomodate different servers having their own rate for resource extraction... e.g. Legends uses a 2.0 modifier. Back on live this was 1.5x the normal rate in the latter years. If you are unsure what your server uses for a resource extraction rate modifier, just leave the default of 1.0 in place. You can always edit it later.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Owners: </b><br/>
    The upper rightmost table displays your defined owners. To
    add a new harvester owner, right-click inside the table and
    select to create an owner. Select a character from the list
    or edit/add any useful but unique name. Initiate values for
    harvesting expertise and entertainer buff; these determine
    the improvement SWGAide adds to an active harvester, the
    same as in-game. </p>
  <p> Notice: if you decide to <b><u>transfer ownership</u></b> of a put-down harvester to another owner, then the applied
    bonuses stick on the harvester. This is so until it is
    re-deeded, exactly as for in-game harvesters. Remember that
    in-game, if the new owner fills up maintenance or power the
    bonus is adjusted to the expertise level of that owner. </p>
  <p> <b>Owners &mdash; Popup menu: </b><br/>
    The popup menu for the this table provides options that are
    related to owners: </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Create owner</b> &ndash; create a new harvester owner for the current galaxy,
    either select an existing player or create a uniquely named
    owner. </b>
    <p> <b>Edit owner</b> &ndash; edit the properties of an existing owner, but not
      the name. Remember that when activating a harvester it is
      possible to adjust the owner's Entertainer buff right there
      and then. </p>
    <p> <b>Export</b> &ndash; write harvesters and owners for the current galaxy
      to file, the two are merged to the same file. Use this to
      backup your definitions, or to transfer them to some other
      galaxy or installation of SWGAide. </p>
    <p> <b>Import file</b> /ndash; import harvesters and owners to the current galaxy
      from file. Any entry with a name that equals an existing
      entry is silently ignored. </p>
    <p> <b>Delete owner</b> &ndash; delete a selected owner. Just custom owners can be
      deleted, not in-game characters. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> <b>Owners &mdash; Create &amp; Edit dialog: </b><br/>
    The dialog for creating and editing owners is the same, but
    the name field is disabled in edit mode: </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Owner name</b> &ndash; select an existing character of the current galaxy,
    or define an owner with a unique name.
    <p> <b>Harvester Storage Efficiency</b> &ndash; the owner's expertise level in this field. </p>
    <p> <b>Harvester Maintenance Efficiency</b> &ndash; the owner's expertise level in this field. </p>
    <p> <b>Harvester Energy Efficiency</b> &ndash; the owner's expertise level in this field. </p>
    <p> <b>Advanced Harvester Technology</b> &ndash; the owner's expertise level in this field. </p>
    <p> <b>Harvester Fair</b> &ndash; the owner's usual level of the Entertainer buff.
      Remember that when activating a harvester it is possible to
      adjust this value right there and then. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Harvester Warnings: </b><br/>
    The upper center panel allows you to specify how many hours
    in advance an alert indicates that an active harvester will
    stop. This feature monitors when maintenance and power are
    drained, and when the hopper is full. The alerts are visual
    and acoustic (optional); the default value is 24 hours. </p>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Activate Harvester Dialog:</b><br/>
    The dialog "Activate Harvester" is opened in one of two
    modes: to activate a harvester for a specific resource; or
    to edit an active harvester. </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> <b>Activate</b> &ndash; at Current Resources panel, select and right-click
      a resource, then select "Add to harvester panel" at the
      popup dialog. </p>
    <p> <b>Edit</b> &ndash; at the main table of active harvesters, select
      and right-click a harvester. You can adjust the very same
      properties that you can do at an in-game harvester, other
      properties are disabled but read their current values. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p> Options and features at the dialog: </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Harvester</b> &ndash; select a harvester to gather the selected resource.
    The list displays inactive harvesters that are suitable for
    the resource class; a harvester is listed as a <u>deed</u>,
    or as one that "<u>stayed put</u>" which denotes an in-game
    harvester which is no pulled up (re-deeded) and it retains
    all buffs that were applied on it when it was put down;
    this mimics how harvesters and bonuses work in-game.
    </p>
    <p> b>Owner</b> &ndash; select an owner for the harvester. If the harvester
      is listed as a deed the selected owner also sets the values
      for harvesting bonuses. However, if the harvester is listed
      as one that "stayed-put" the old bonuses are displayed at
      the details panel to the right; these bonuses stick until
      the harvester is re-deeded and another owner simply mimics
      a structure-transfer. To <u>reset</u> a harvester to "deed"
      form, right-click the harvester drop-down list, or at the
      harvester details panel for another dialog. </p>
    <p> <b>Resource name</b> &ndash; reads the name of the resource, cannot be edited. </p>
    <p> <b>Resource class</b> &ndash; reads the resource class, cannot be edited. </p>
    <p> <b>Misc notes</b> &ndash; enter any kind of text: harvester location, planet,
      intended use of resource, etc... </p>
    <p> <b>Add to Inventory</b> &ndash; select this option to add the hopper content to
      inventory each time the harvester is "refreshed". <B>Tips:</b> select this option when you activate a
      harvester which adds one unit to inventory. That one unit
      serves as a place-holder and to stop unwanted alerts; with
      the place-holders you do not need to manually add resources
      to inventory; neither resource guards or Today's Alert will
      alert you for something you are already harvesting. </p>
    <p> <b>Self powered</b> &ndash; select this check-box if you apply a "Make a
      Harvester Self Powered" device to the harvester, something
      nullifies its power consumption. </p>
    <p> <b>Concentration %</b> &ndash; specify the resource concentration for the location
      where the harvester is put down, as it reads at the survey
      device. This value is used when SWGAide estimates amount at
      hopper, which also is the amount that is added to inventory
      if that option is selected. <b>Tips:</b> if you use the cluster feature, see below,
      you specify the highest value for the location so that
      alerts are not delayed. </p>
    <p> Remember that the estimated amount is never 100% accurate,
      there are hidden decimals and other factors that makes it
      deviate from the final yield from your harvesters. Thence
      you must adjust the value at the inventory no matter what,
      and it is pointless to spend too much time on accuracy at
      these panels. </p>
    <p> <b>Maintenance</b> &ndash; specify the amount of maintenance that is added to
      the harvester. This is also the amount which is added to
      the harvester at a "refresh". </p>
    <p> <b>Power</b> &ndash; specify the amount of power that is added to
      the harvester. This is also the amount which is added to
      the harvester at a "refresh". </p>
    <p> <b>Harvester details</b> &ndash; this panel reads the properties and bonuses of the
      harvester. For a deed its bonuses are pending until it is
      activated. If it stayed-put the values are from the date it
      was put down, no matter who the current owner is. </p>
    <p> <b>Harv Fair</b> &ndash; adjust the Entertainer buff Harvester Fair for the
      current owner before you activate the harvester. This value
      cannot be adjusted for an active or put-down harvester;
      this works the same as in-game. </p>
    <p> <b>Harvester Cluster</b> &ndash; specify how many harvesters you put down in-game
      and let this one harvester represent them all, to denote
      a cluster of in-game harvesters; but use it only for
      harvesters of equal BER and hopper size. The cluster size
      just multiplies the amount that is added to inventory at
      each "refresh". <b>Tips:</b> use this feature to reduce the number of
      active harvesters at this panel. There is no need for many
      entries that essentially monitors the same thing; as long
      as you maintain all harvesters at one location at the same
      time alerts and whatever are monitored by just one entry. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <p> <b>Active Harvesters:</b><br/>
    The main table displays active harvesters for the current
    galaxy. Hover the mouse over the column titles to read the
    "tool-tip" texts. It is possible to <u>edit cells</u> for
    maintenance, power, and notes; just double click such a
    cell and edit its value. </p>
  <p> Any alert colors one or more table cells in yellow or red;
    yellow warns that the harvester will stop soon, red that it
    already is stopped; either for maintenance or power.
    If a resource is depleted the cell is colored in purple. </p>
  <p> <b>Active Harvesters &mdash; Popup menu: </b><br/>
    The popup menu for the this table provides options that are
    related to active harvesters. Some options are doubled at
    the harvesters and owners tables, see their help texts. </p>
  <blockquote> <b>Refresh harvester</b> &ndash; empty the hopper and replenish maintenance and
    power. The "add-to-inventory" option determines if hopper
    content is added to inventory, possibly multiplied by the
    cluster size.
    <p> <b>Edit active harvester</b> &ndash; open the dialog to edit certain properties of the
      selected harvester, see above. Many options are disabled,
      this works as in-game mechanics. </p>
    <p> <b>Filter inventory </b> &ndash; filter resource inventory for the resource class
      of the active harvester. </p>
    <p> <b>Select current </b> &ndash; select the harvested resource at Current Resources. </p>
    <p> <b>Select schematic use </b> &ndash; select the harvested resource class at Schematics:
      Resource Class Use. At that panel you can see which
      schematics that calls for the resource class by name,
      or which schematics that may use it. If the resource class
      is not a <i>named resource class </i> it is still selected
      at the right-most tree but the middle list displays the
      first super-class that is a named resource class. </p>
    <p> <b>Numerical hopper totals </b> &ndash; select this to display numerical values rather than
      percent at the hopper column. </p>
    <p> <b>Display end dates</b> &ndash; select this to display estimated end dates for
      maintenance, power, and hopper. </p>
    <p> <b>Mark depleted </b> &ndash; send a depleted-resource message to <nobr>swgaide.com</nobr> for the harvested resource. </p>
    <p> <b>Deactivate harvester (stays put)</b> &ndash; deactivate the harvester but let it retain applied
      bonuses. No bonuses, Entertainer buff, or self-powered mode
      are reset. This mimics deactivating in-game harvesters and
      reactivating them to harvest another resource but they stay
      put at the same location and retain all applied bonuses. </p>
    <p> To "re-deed" a "stayed-put" harvester you must open the
      activate-harvester dialog at Current Resources, select the
      harvester, and right-click the harvester list or at the
      details panel to bring up a dialog. </p>
    <p> <b>Deactivate harvester (re-deed)</b> &ndash; deactivate the harvester and return it to deed;
      this resets any buff, bonuses, and self-powered device.
      This mimics re-deeding in-game harvesters. </p>
