  <br />
  <p> First-time install:
    SWGAide must initiate itself, find SWG and the galaxies and
    characters you play; this is done by selecting your main game folder. </p>
  <p> Otherwise:
    if you are a regular user but you see this screen and if
    you want to recover a backup file, exit SWGAide now and see
    the README file. Otherwise, continue. </p>
  <br />
  <p> Enjoy </p>
